###  ‚úçÔ∏è  Who am I?
- Doctor of medicine who switched career towards Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Web Dev üå±
- I've been enjoying it for the first time since I built my first static website and it became a real passion when I built my first dynamic medical web app ü©∫
- I'm finishing my 2 years curriculum at Holberton School and I'm on the lookout for a back or front-end role as a software engineer. ‚öô
- I'd especially love to work on-site in a medium-sized team which I think is the best to gain experience while making a meaningful impact. If you're hiring, let's chat! ü§ù
- I lived in 3 countries and I speak 4 languages (French, English, Swedish, and Russian) üåè
- I love to run, climb, read, and play guitar. üßó
- I've biked through the frosty wilderness of Norway, pitching a tent and sleeping beneath a majestic glacier ‚ùÑÔ∏è 
- I wrote a little book :book:, have already tried to launch my own business üë®‚Äçüíª and have already been in a music band üé∏
