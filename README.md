- 🌱 I'm an Anesthesiologist currently expanding my horizons at Holberton School France 🇫🇷 by studying in the field of Software Engeneering and Computer Science. 

- 🔭 I believe in the power of technology to revolutionize healthcare and improve patients' lives, and I'm excited to fuse my medical background with cutting-edge software engineering skills.

- :bulb: As a lifelong learner and problem solver, I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals who are driven by curiosity and innovation. 

- 🚀Let's connect and make a difference together! Feel free to check out my projects, share feedback, or reach out for potential collaborations. 

- Let's build a healthier and more connected world, one line of code at a time. 💻💉🌍

-  :book:I love to read and play guitar. :guitar:

- ⚡ Fun fact! I've biked 🚴‍♂️ through the frosty wilderness of Norway, pitching a tent and snoozing beneath a majestic glacier – all in the name of adventure and camaraderie! ❄️🏔️
