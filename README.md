###  ✍️  Who am I?
- I'm a doctor currently studying Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Web Development. 🌱

- As a lifelong learner and problem solver, I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals driven by curiosity and innovation. :bulb:

- Feel free to check out my projects, share feedback, or reach out for potential collaborations. 🚀

- I love to read and play guitar. :book: 
  
- I speak French, English, Swedish and Russian. 🌏 

- Fun fact! I've biked through the frosty wilderness of Norway, pitching a tent and sleeping beneath a majestic glacier – all in the name of adventure and camaraderie! ❄️
